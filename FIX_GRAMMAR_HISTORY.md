# Fix for Grammar Checker History Issue

## Problem
The grammar checker history feature is not working due to a 404 error when trying to access the `grammar_checker_history` table in Supabase.

## Root Cause
The `grammar_checker_history` table may not have been properly created in the database, or there might be permission issues preventing access to the table.

## Solution
We've created a new migration file that ensures the table is properly set up with all necessary permissions.

## Steps to Fix

1. Apply the new migration:
   ```bash
   npx supabase migration up
   ```

2. If you're running this locally, you might need to reset your local database:
   ```bash
   npx supabase db reset
   ```

3. Restart your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## What the Fix Does

1. Creates the `grammar_checker_history` table if it doesn't exist
2. Ensures Row Level Security (RLS) is properly configured
3. Sets up the necessary policies for insert, select, and delete operations
4. Grants appropriate permissions to anon and authenticated users
5. Creates indexes for better query performance

## Changes Made

- Added a new migration file: `supabase/migrations/20251006200000_fix_grammar_checker_history_table.sql`
- Improved error handling in the frontend components
- Updated the clear history function to use proper Supabase syntax

## If the Problem Persists

1. Check that your Supabase project is properly configured
2. Verify that your environment variables are correctly set:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
3. Make sure you've run all migrations
4. Check the Supabase dashboard to verify the table exists
