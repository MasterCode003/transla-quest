# Grammar Checker History Feature

## Overview
This document explains the implementation of the separate Grammar Checker History feature, which is now distinct from the Translation History.

## Database Changes

### New Table: grammar_checker_history
A new table has been created with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.grammar_checker_history (
  id UUID NOT NULL DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  original_text TEXT NOT NULL,
  checked_text TEXT NOT NULL,
  language VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
  suggestions JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

### Key Fields
- `id`: Unique identifier for each grammar check record
- `original_text`: The text that was checked for grammar
- `checked_text`: The AI's response with corrections and suggestions
- `language`: The language of the text (en, fil, hil)
- `suggestions`: JSONB field for structured suggestion data (reserved for future use)
- `created_at`: Timestamp of when the check was performed

## Frontend Implementation

### New Component: GrammarCheckerHistory.tsx
A new React component displays the grammar check history with:
- List of recent grammar checks
- Language identification for each entry
- Timestamps for when checks were performed
- Ability to clear all history

### Updated Index Page
The main page now conditionally displays either:
- TranslationHistory component when in translation mode
- GrammarCheckerHistory component when in grammar check mode

### Navigation
Added dedicated navigation buttons to switch between translation and grammar check modes.

## Backend Implementation

### Supabase Function Updates
The existing translate function now:
- Handles both translation and grammar check modes
- Uses mode-specific system prompts
- Returns processed text in a consistent format

### Type Definitions
Updated Supabase types to include the new grammar_checker_history table structure.

## Usage

### Saving Grammar Checks
When a user performs a grammar check:
1. The original text and AI response are saved to grammar_checker_history
2. The language is recorded
3. Timestamp is automatically added

### Viewing History
Users can view their grammar check history in the dedicated panel which:
- Shows the most recent 50 checks
- Displays language and timestamp for each entry
- Shows both original text and AI suggestions
- Allows clearing all history with one click

## Migration
The feature includes a migration script that:
- Creates the new grammar_checker_history table
- Sets up appropriate RLS (Row Level Security) policies
- Adds indexes for performance optimization

## Future Enhancements
- Parse AI responses to extract structured suggestions
- Add filtering by language
- Implement pagination for large history sets
- Add export functionality for history data
